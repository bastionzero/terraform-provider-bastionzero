## v0.1.2 (August 30, 2023)

NOTES:


* Upgraded [`bastionzero-sdk-go`](https://github.com/bastionzero/bastionzero-sdk-go) to v0.6.0 ([#43](https://github.com/bastionzero/terraform-provider-bastionzero/issues/43)).


BUG FIXES:


* resource/targetconnect_policy: Fix `verbs` validation to match behavior of the BastionZero API; `RDP` and `SQLServer` are permitted by the remote API ([#36](https://github.com/bastionzero/terraform-provider-bastionzero/issues/36)).


* resource/environment: Remove require replacement behavior when an environment's `name` changes since the BastionZero API permits editing an environment's name after creation ([#35](https://github.com/bastionzero/terraform-provider-bastionzero/issues/35)).
