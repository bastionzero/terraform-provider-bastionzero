# bastionzero_db_targets (Data Source)

Get a list of all Db targets in your BastionZero organization.

Note: You can use the [`bastionzero_db_target`](db_target) data source to obtain
metadata about a single Db target if you already know the `id`.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```terraform
data "bastionzero_db_targets" "example" {}

# Find all Db targets with remote port 5432
locals {
  psql_targets = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_db_targets.example.targets
    : each if each.remote_port == 5432
  ]
}
```

### Get the target by name

```terraform
# Using Terraform >= 1.x syntax

data "bastionzero_db_targets" "example" {}

# Find target with specific name. `db_target` is null if not found.
locals {
  db_target = one([
    for each in data.bastionzero_db_targets.example.targets
    : each if each.name == "example-target"
  ])
}
```

### Group Db targets with same base proxy target

```terraform
data "bastionzero_db_targets" "example" {}

# Group Db targets with same base proxy target
locals {
  db_targets_by_base = {
    for each in data.bastionzero_db_targets.example.targets
    : each.proxy_target_id => { id = each.id, name = each.name }...
  }
}
```
