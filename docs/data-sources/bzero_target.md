# bastionzero_bzero_target (Data Source)

Get information about a specific Bzero target in your BastionZero organization.

Specify exactly one of `id` or `name`. When specifying a `name`, an error is triggered if more than one Bzero target is found. This data source retries with exponential backoff (provide optional `timeouts.read` [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) to control how long to retry. Defaults to 15 minutes.) until the Bzero target is found. This is useful if there is a chance the target does not exist yet (e.g. the target is in the process of registering to BastionZero).

## Example Usage

### Basic example

Get the Bzero target by ID:

```terraform
data "bastionzero_bzero_target" "example" {
  id = "<target-id>"
}
```

### Timeout example

Get the Bzero target by name and wait up to 30 seconds before failing if the target does not exist.

```terraform
data "bastionzero_bzero_target" "example" {
  name = "example-target"
  timeouts = {
    # Wait up to 30 seconds to find target with name "example-target"
    read = "30s"
  }
}
```

- `environment_id` (String) The target's environment's ID.
- `last_agent_update` (String) The time this target's proxy agent last had a transition change in status formatted as a UTC timestamp string in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format. Null if there has not been a single transition change.
- `region` (String) The BastionZero region that this target has connected to (follows same naming convention as AWS regions).

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

- `control_channel_id` (String) The control channel's unique ID.
- `end_time` (String) The time this control channel disconnected from the connection node formatted as a UTC timestamp string in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format. Null if the control channel is still active.
- `start_time` (String) The time this control channel connected to the connection node formatted as a UTC timestamp string in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format.
