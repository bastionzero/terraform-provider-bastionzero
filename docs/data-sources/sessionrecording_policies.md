# bastionzero_sessionrecording_policies (Data Source)

Get a list of all session recording policies in your BastionZero organization. A session recording policy governs whether users' I/O during shell connections are recorded.

This data source is useful if the policies in question are not managed by
Terraform, or you need to utilize any of the policies' data.

-> **Note** You can use the
[`bastionzero_sessionrecording_policy`](sessionrecording_policy) data source to
obtain metadata about a single policy if you already know the `id`.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```terraform
data "bastionzero_sessionrecording_policies" "example" {}
```

### Get the policy by name

```terraform
# Using Terraform >= 1.x syntax

data "bastionzero_sessionrecording_policies" "example" {}

# Find policy with specific name. `policy` is null if not found.
output "policy" {
  value = one([
    for each in data.bastionzero_sessionrecording_policies.example.policies
    : each if each.name == "example-policy"
  ])
}
```
