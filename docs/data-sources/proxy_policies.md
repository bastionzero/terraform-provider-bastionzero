# bastionzero_proxy_policies (Data Source)

Get a list of all proxy policies in your BastionZero organization. A proxy policy provides access to `Db` and `Web` targets.

This data source is useful if the policies in question are not managed by
Terraform, or you need to utilize any of the policies' data.

Note: You can use the [`bastionzero_proxy_policy`](proxy_policy) data
source to obtain metadata about a single policy if you already know the `id`.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```terraform
data "bastionzero_proxy_policies" "example" {}
```

### Get the policy by name

```terraform
# Using Terraform >= 1.x syntax

data "bastionzero_proxy_policies" "example" {}

# Find policy with specific name. `policy` is null if not found.
locals {
  policy = one([
    for each in data.bastionzero_proxy_policies.example.policies
    : each if each.name == "example-policy"
  ])
}
```
