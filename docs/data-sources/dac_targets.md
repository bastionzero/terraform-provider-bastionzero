# bastionzero_dac_targets (Data Source)

Get a list of all dynamic access configuration (DAC) targets in your BastionZero organization.

Dynamic access configurations configure the provisioning of dynamic access targets (DATs). Learn more about the use cases of DATs and how to configure a DAT provisioning server [here](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/deployment/installing-the-agent#dynamic-access-targets). 

Note: You can use the [`bastionzero_dac_target`](dac_target) data source to
obtain metadata about a single DAC target if you already know the `id`.

## Example Usage

### Basic example

```terraform
data "bastionzero_dac_targets" "example" {}

# Find all DAC targets whose health endpoints are healthy
output "healthy_dacs" {
  value = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_dac_targets.example.targets
    : each if each.status == "Online"
  ]
}
```

### Get the target by name

```terraform
# Using Terraform >= 1.x syntax

data "bastionzero_dac_targets" "example" {}

# Find target with specific name. `dac_target` is null if not found.
output "dac_target" {
  value = one([
    for each in data.bastionzero_dac_targets.example.targets
    : each if each.name == "example-target"
  ])
}
```
