# bastionzero_bzero_targets (Data Source)

Get a list of all Bzero targets in your BastionZero organization.

Note: You can use the [`bastionzero_bzero_target`](bzero_target) data source to
obtain metadata about a single Bzero target if you already know the `id` or
`name`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "bastionzero_bzero_targets" "example" {}

# Find all Bzero targets whose names contain "ubuntu"
output "ubuntu_targets" {
  value = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_bzero_targets.example.targets
    : each if can(regex("ubuntu", each.name))
  ]
}
```
