# bastionzero_cluster_target (Data Source)

Get information about a specific Cluster target in your BastionZero organization.

Specify exactly one of `id` or `name`. When specifying a `name`, an error is triggered if more than one Cluster target is found. This data source retries with exponential backoff (provide optional `timeouts.read` [duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) to control how long to retry. Defaults to 15 mintues.) until the Cluster target is found. This is useful if there is a chance the target does not exist yet (e.g. the target is in the process of registering to BastionZero).
