# BastionZero Provider

The BastionZero provider is used to interact with select APIs supported by
[BastionZero](https://www.bastionzero.com/). It provides resources to manage
your BastionZero
[policies](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/admin-guide/authorization#policy-management)
and environments, and data sources to fetch your users, groups, service
accounts, and targets in your BastionZero organization. The provider needs to be
configured with an API secret before it can be used (please see the
[example](#example-usage) below).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data
sources.

## BastionZero Setup

You need to provision an API key and use its secret to configure the BastionZero
provider. Manage your API keys at the API key panel found
[here](https://cloud.bastionzero.com/admin/apikeys). See the [admin
guide](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/admin-guide/authorization#creating-an-api-key)
for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bastionzero = {
      source  = "bastionzero/bastionzero"
      version = "~> 0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Set the variable value in *.tfvars file
# or using -var="bz_api_secret=..." CLI option
variable "bz_api_secret" {}

# Configure the BastionZero Provider
provider "bastionzero" {
  api_secret = var.bz_api_secret
}
```

### Configuring using an environment variable

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    bastionzero = {
      source  = "bastionzero/bastionzero"
      version = "~> 0.0"
    }
  }
}

# An empty provider configuration assumes the BASTIONZERO_API_SECRET environment
# variable is set. The provider uses the environment variable's value as the
# `api_secret` field.
provider "bastionzero" {}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_endpoint` (String) This can be used to override the base URL for BastionZero API requests (Defaults to the value of the `BASTIONZERO_HOST` environment variable or https://cloud.bastionzero.com/ if unset). Typical users of this provider should not set this value.
- `api_secret` (String, Sensitive) API secret used to authenticate API requests sent to BastionZero. This can also be specified using the `BASTIONZERO_API_SECRET` environment variable.
