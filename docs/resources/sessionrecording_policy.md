# bastionzero_sessionrecording_policy (Resource)

Provides a BastionZero session recording policy. Session recording policies govern whether users' I/O during shell connections are recorded.

Learn more about session recording policies [here](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/admin-guide/authorization#session-recording).

~> **Note on policy name** All policies (of any type) must have a unique name. If the
configured [`name`](#name) is not unique, an error is thrown.

## Example Usage

Enable session recording for all users and service accounts:

```terraform
# Get all users and service accounts
data "bastionzero_users" "u" {}
data "bastionzero_service_accounts" "u" {}

resource "bastionzero_sessionrecording_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  description = "Policy managed by Terraform."
  subjects = [
    for each in concat(
      data.bastionzero_users.u.users,
      data.bastionzero_service_accounts.u.service_accounts
    )
    : { id = each.id, type = each.type }
  ]
}
```
