# bastionzero_proxy_policy (Resource)

Provides a BastionZero proxy policy. Proxy policies provide access to Db and Web targets.

Learn more about proxy policies [here](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/admin-guide/authorization#proxy).

~> **Note on policy name** All policies (of any type) must have a unique name. If the
configured [`name`](#name) is not unique, an error is thrown.

## Example Usage

### Environment based policy

Create a proxy policy that allows access to targets in a set of environments.

```terraform
# Get all users, groups, and environments 
data "bastionzero_users" "u" {}
data "bastionzero_groups" "g" {}
data "bastionzero_environments" "e" {}

locals {
  # Define, by email address, users to add to the policy
  users = ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com", "charlie@example.com"]
  # Define, by name, the groups and environments to add to the policy
  groups = ["Engineering", "Product"]
  envs   = ["Default", "Demo-Env"]
}

resource "bastionzero_proxy_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  description = "Policy managed by Terraform."
  subjects = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_users.u.users
    : { id = each.id, type = each.type } if contains(local.users, each.email)
  ]
  groups = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_groups.g.groups
    : { id = each.id, name = each.name } if contains(local.groups, each.name)
  ]
  environments = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_environments.e.environments
    : each.id if contains(local.envs, each.name)
  ]
}
```

### Target based policy 

Create a proxy policy that allows access to specific targets.

```terraform
# Get all groups, Db targets, and Web targets
data "bastionzero_groups" "g" {}
data "bastionzero_db_targets" "t" {}
data "bastionzero_web_targets" "t" {}

locals {
  # Define, by name, the groups and targets to add to the policy
  groups  = ["Product", "Marketing"]
  targets = ["demo-psql", "grafana"]
}

resource "bastionzero_proxy_policy" "example" {
  name        = "example-policy"
  description = "Policy managed by Terraform."
  groups = [
    for each in data.bastionzero_groups.g.groups
    : { id = each.id, name = each.name } if contains(local.groups, each.name)
  ]
  targets = [
    for each in concat(
      data.bastionzero_db_targets.t.targets,
      data.bastionzero_web_targets.t.targets
    )
    : { id = each.id, type = each.type } if contains(local.targets, each.name)
  ]
}
```
