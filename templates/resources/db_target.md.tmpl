Learn more about Db targets [here](https://docs.bastionzero.com/docs/deployment/installing-the-agent#databases).

~> **Note on proxy target/environment** A Db target _must_ be configured with
either a [`proxy_target_id`](#proxy_target_id) or a
[`proxy_environment_id`](#proxy_environment_id); it cannot be configured with
both attributes set and neither of them can be omitted.

## Example Usage

### Db target via proxy target

Create a Db target with the default authentication configuration
(non-passwordless), and use a Bzero target to proxy the connection to the
configured database.

{{ tffile "examples/resources/bastionzero_db_target/proxy-target.tf" }}

### Db target via proxy environment

Create a Db target with the default authentication configuration
(non-passwordless) and a proxy environment. When a user connects to this target,
the Bzero or Cluster target with the least number of open connections in this
environment is used to proxy the connection to the configured database.
