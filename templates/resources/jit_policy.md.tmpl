{{ .Description | trimspace }}

~> **Note on policy name** All policies (of any type) must have a unique name.
If the configured [`name`](#name) is not unique, an error is thrown.

~> **Note on child policies** A JIT policy's [`child_policies`](#child_policies)
can only refer to policies of the following types:
[`TargetConnect`](targetconnect_policy), [`Kubernetes`](kubernetes_policy), or
[`Proxy`](proxy_policy). If any of the referenced policies, are not of the valid
type, then an error is returned when creating/updating the JIT policy.

## Example Usage

Create a JIT policy that allows root/privileged access to select targets for the
"Engineering" group with approval by an administrator in one's BastionZero
organization:

{{ tffile "examples/resources/bastionzero_jit_policy/resource.tf" }}
