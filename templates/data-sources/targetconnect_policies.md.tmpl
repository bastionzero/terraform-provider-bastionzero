{{ .Description | trimspace }}

This data source is useful if the policies in question are not managed by
Terraform, or you need to utilize any of the policies' data.

Note: You can use the [`bastionzero_targetconnect_policy`](targetconnect_policy)
data source to obtain metadata about a single policy if you already know the
`id`.

## Example Usage
